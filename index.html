 <p><b><u> पत्रम् – पञ्चमम् पाठ्यांशनाम- श्रीविद्याविमर्शः (compiled on 2080.02.32)</u></b></p> 
 

<p> <b><u>शास्त्रावतारः</u></b>As per Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva is said to have manifested in various forms or avatars for specific purposes. While there are numerous avatars attributed to Lord Shiva, here are five prominent avatars:</p>
<p><b>1. Pashupati:</b> Pashupati is considered one of the earliest forms of Lord Shiva. In this form, Lord Shiva is depicted as the lord of all living beings and the master of animals. Pashupati represents the power and harmony between humans and nature.</p>
<p><b>2. Ardhanarishvara:</b> Ardhanarishvara is the divine androgynous form of Lord Shiva, symbolizing the unity of masculine and feminine energies. In this form, half of Lord Shiva's body represents the male principle (Shiva), while the other half represents the female principle (Shakti or Parvati). Ardhanarishvara signifies the inseparable nature of the divine masculine and feminine aspects.</p>
<p><b>3. Nataraja:</b> Nataraja is the cosmic dancer form of Lord Shiva. In this form, Lord Shiva is depicted as the supreme dancer who performs the celestial dance of creation, preservation, and destruction. Nataraja symbolizes the eternal rhythm of the universe and the divine balance between order and chaos.</p>
<p><b>4. Bhairava:</b> Bhairava is a fierce and wrathful form of Lord Shiva. As Bhairava, Lord Shiva is associated with destruction and protection. He is often depicted with a dog as his vehicle and is believed to protect devotees and remove obstacles on the spiritual path.</p>
<p><b>5. Mahakala:</b> Mahakala, also known as Kala Bhairava, is the fierce aspect of Lord Shiva associated with time and death. He is often depicted as a black or dark-blue deity with multiple arms, symbolizing his immense power. Mahakala represents the eternal flow of time and the ultimate transcendence of death.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the many avatars associated with Lord Shiva. Each form represents different aspects of Lord Shiva's power, symbolism, and cosmic role in Hindu mythology.</p>
<p>According to Tantric philosophy, scriptures (literary and scholarly knowledge) are considered confidential and significant. Tantra encompasses various practices, mantras, yantras, rituals, worship, meditative elements, and methods of discipline, which are described and provided through scriptures. This knowledge is acquired through the guru-disciple tradition and is kept confidential to maintain its purity and efficacy.</p>
<p>Tantric followers believe that this confidentiality is particularly embedded within the administration of temples, sacred places, pilgrimage sites, ascetics, and gurus. The purpose is to ensure that the proper and correct use of scriptures remains limited to advanced and deserving practitioners, and does not fall into the wrong hands. Confidentiality is therefore crucial to safeguard the authenticity and integrity of the various tantric practices and worship methods.</p>
<p><b><u>"शास्त्रेऽनधिकारिणः" (Shastre'nahikarinaḥ)</b></u> is a Sanskrit phrase used in Tantric philosophy. It can be translated to mean "Those who are not qualified have no authority over the scriptures."</p>
<p>In Tantrism, this phrase emphasizes the importance of proper qualification and readiness when it comes to understanding and practicing the teachings of the scriptures. It suggests that those who lack the necessary qualifications, understanding, or spiritual maturity should not assert authority or make interpretations about the scriptures.</p>
<p>Tantric philosophy places a strong emphasis on the guidance of a qualified guru or teacher, who plays a crucial role in imparting the knowledge of the scriptures and providing appropriate instructions for tantric practices. The idea behind "शास्त्रेऽनधिकारिणः" is that only those who have received proper initiation, training, and guidance from a qualified guru are eligible to engage with the scriptures and apply their teachings in a meaningful and effective manner.</p>
<p>This principle is intended to protect the sanctity of the scriptures, ensure that they are understood and practiced correctly, and prevent misuse or misinterpretation by individuals who are not adequately prepared. It highlights the importance of humility, reverence, and adherence to the traditional guru-disciple relationship in the context of tantric knowledge and practice.</p>
<p><b><u>सङ्केत त्रयोद्देशः (Sanketatrayoddeshah)</b></u> is a term used in Tantric philosophy and practice. It refers to the three modes of communication or expression employed in Tantra. These three modes are:</p>
<p><b>1. वाचिक (Vachika):</b> Vachika refers to verbal or spoken communication. It includes the use of language, words, mantras, and chanting. Verbal communication plays an important role in Tantra, as mantras and sacred sounds are believed to have transformative and powerful effects on the practitioner.</p>
<p><b>2. अंगिक (Angika):</b> Angika refers to non-verbal or physical communication. It involves the use of body language, gestures, postures, and mudras (hand gestures). Through conscious movements and bodily expressions, specific energies and intentions can be conveyed and channeled in Tantric practices.</p>
<p><b>3. मानसिक (Manasika):</b> Manasika refers to mental or internal communication. It involves the subtle and internal processes of the mind, such as visualization, meditation, concentration, and mental imagery. Through the power of the mind and focused awareness, practitioners can access and work with deeper levels of consciousness and spiritual states.</p>
<p>These three modes of communication are considered essential in Tantric rituals, practices, and ceremonies. They provide a comprehensive framework for expression, connecting different aspects of the individual's being—verbal, physical, and mental—in the spiritual journey. Each mode has its own significance and purpose, and they are often used together in a synchronized manner to facilitate spiritual growth, transformation, and the attainment of higher states of consciousness.</p>
<p><b><u>सङ्केतत्रयज्ञानफलम् (Sanketatrayajñānaphalam)</b></u> refers to the threefold results or fruits of the knowledge of symbols in Tantrism. In Tantric philosophy and practice, symbols hold great significance as they represent deeper spiritual truths and serve as vehicles for transformation and realization. The threefold results of the knowledge of symbols are as follows:</p>
<p><b>1. दिक्षा-फल (Diksha-phala):</b> Diksha-phala refers to the result or fruit of initiation. Initiation (diksha) is a sacred and formal process through which an individual is initiated into a specific Tantric tradition or practice by a qualified guru. The knowledge and understanding of symbols acquired through diksha lead to spiritual growth, purification, and the opening of higher levels of consciousness.</p>
<p><b>2. मन्त्र-फल (Mantra-phala):</b> Mantra-phala refers to the result or fruit of the mantra. Mantras are sacred sounds, syllables, or phrases that are used in Tantric rituals and practices. Through the knowledge and proper recitation of mantras associated with specific symbols, practitioners can experience transformative effects on the mind, body, and spirit. Mantra-phala includes spiritual progress, empowerment, and the awakening of dormant energies.</p>
<p><b>3. आचार-फल (Achara-phala):</b> Achara-phala refers to the result or fruit of ritualistic practices. Rituals and ceremonies are an integral part of Tantric tradition, and they often involve the use of symbols in various forms. By understanding and engaging in ritualistic practices associated with symbols, practitioners can experience purification, alignment with cosmic forces, and the manifestation of desired outcomes in their lives.</p>
<p>These threefold results highlight the transformative power of symbols in Tantrism. Through the knowledge and utilization of symbols in initiation, mantras, and rituals, practitioners can access deeper layers of consciousness, connect with divine energies, and cultivate spiritual growth and realization. The fruits of this knowledge include spiritual empowerment, purification, and the attainment of desired goals on the spiritual path.</p>
<p><b><u>अनुबन्धचतुष्टयनिर्देशः (Anubandhachatustayanirdesha)</b></u> is a concept in Tantrism that refers to the fourfold guidance or instructions provided in Tantric texts. These instructions serve as a framework for practitioners to engage in Tantric practices effectively and to attain spiritual realization. The fourfold guidance includes:</p>
<p><b>1. उपदेश (Upadesha):</b> Upadesha means instruction or guidance. It involves imparting the teachings and knowledge of Tantra to the practitioner. Upadesha provides the theoretical understanding of the philosophy, principles, and practices of Tantra. It includes the study of scriptures, texts, and philosophical concepts that form the foundation of Tantric practice.</p>
<p><b>2. उपासना (Upasana):</b> Upasana refers to the practical aspect of Tantric worship and meditation. It involves engaging in rituals, ceremonies, and meditative practices with devotion and reverence. Upasana focuses on the experiential aspect of Tantra, where the practitioner cultivates a deep connection with the divine through visualization, mantra recitation, and contemplation of sacred symbols.</p>
<p><b>3. विधान (Vidhana):</b> Vidhana refers to the rules, procedures, and methodologies prescribed for Tantric rituals and practices. It provides detailed instructions on how to perform rituals, including the use of specific symbols, mudras, mantras, and offerings. Vidhana ensures that the practitioner follows the proper guidelines and techniques to maximize the effectiveness of the rituals and attain the desired spiritual outcomes.</p>
<p><b>4. योग (Yoga):</b> Yoga in this context refers to the integration and harmonization of body, mind, and spirit through specific practices. It involves techniques such as asanas (physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), and meditation to purify and balance the physical and energetic systems. Yoga in Tantra aims to awaken and channel the dormant spiritual energies within the practitioner.</p>
<p>The fourfold guidance of Anubandhachatustayanirdesha provides a comprehensive approach to Tantric practice, combining theoretical understanding, practical worship, adherence to rituals, and the cultivation of inner harmony and balance. It guides the practitioner on the path of self-realization, spiritual evolution, and the direct experience of the divine.</p>
<p><b><u>चक्रसङ्केत निरूपणारम्भः (Chakrasanketa Nirupanarambhah)</b></u> is a term in Tantrism that refers to the initiation or beginning of the explanation of the chakra system. The chakras are subtle energy centers or vortexes within the body, according to Tantric philosophy. They are believed to be located along the central channel (sushumna) and are associated with specific qualities, elements, and spiritual aspects.</p>
<p>Chakrasanketa Nirupanarambhah signifies the start of the elucidation or exploration of the chakra system. This initiation may occur through various means, such as the teachings of a guru, scriptures, or personal experience. It marks the beginning of the understanding and exploration of the chakras and their significance in Tantric practice.</p>
<p>The chakra system is an integral part of Tantric philosophy and practice, as it represents the subtle energy anatomy of the human body. Each chakra is associated with specific physical, emotional, and spiritual qualities. The understanding and activation of the chakras play a vital role in balancing and harmonizing the energetic system, awakening dormant potentials, and facilitating spiritual growth.</p>
<p>Chakrasanketa Nirupanarambhah sets the stage for the exploration and study of the chakra system, enabling practitioners to delve deeper into the understanding, activation, and utilization of the chakras for personal transformation and spiritual evolution. It signifies the beginning of the journey to unlock the profound wisdom and potential held within the chakras.</p>
<p><b><u>सृष्टिप्रलयनिरूपणम् (Srishtipralaya Nirupanam)</b></u> in Tantrism refers to the exposition or explanation of the process of creation and dissolution. It explores the concepts of cosmic creation, sustenance, and dissolution, as well as the underlying principles and forces that govern these processes.</p>
<p>According to Tantric philosophy, the universe undergoes cycles of creation (srishti), preservation or sustenance (sthiti), and dissolution (pralaya). These cycles are seen as expressions of the divine cosmic energy and are intricately linked to the play of the creative and destructive forces within the cosmos.</p>
<p>Srishtipralaya Nirupanam delves into the understanding of these cyclic processes and their significance in the context of spiritual evolution. It may involve teachings, symbolic representations, rituals, and contemplative practices aimed at gaining insights into the nature of creation and dissolution.</p>
<p>The exposition of Srishtipralaya Nirupanam sheds light on the interplay of energies, principles, and cosmic forces involved in the manifestation and dissolution of the universe. It provides a framework for practitioners to comprehend the transient nature of the phenomenal world and to recognize the deeper reality that underlies it.</p>
<p>By contemplating and understanding the processes of creation and dissolution, practitioners in Tantrism seek to transcend the limitations of the material realm and attain a deeper realization of the eternal and transcendent aspects of existence. It serves as a means to align one's consciousness with the cosmic rhythms and to cultivate a profound understanding of the cycles of creation and dissolution as they relate to one's own spiritual journey.</p>
<p><b><u>बैन्दवचक्रस्य निरूपणम् (Baindavachakrasya Nirupanam)</b></u> in Tantrism refers to the exposition or explanation of the Bindu Chakra. The Bindu Chakra, also known as the Ajna Chakra or the Third Eye, is an important energy center located in the forehead between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>In Tantric philosophy, the Bindu Chakra is associated with higher consciousness, intuition, and spiritual insight. It is considered the seat of divine knowledge and represents the point of union between individual consciousness and universal consciousness.</p>
<p>Baindavachakrasya Nirupanam involves the detailed elucidation of the Bindu Chakra and its significance in Tantric practice. It may include teachings, practices, and symbolic representations related to the activation, balancing, and exploration of this energy center.</p>
<p>The Bindu Chakra is believed to be the gateway to higher states of consciousness and spiritual awakening. It is associated with the transcendence of duality and the realization of non-dual awareness. Through practices such as meditation, mantra repetition, and visualization, practitioners seek to awaken and activate the Bindu Chakra, allowing the flow of divine energy and expanded perception.</p>
<p>The exposition of Baindavachakrasya Nirupanam provides guidance and instructions for practitioners to engage in practices aimed at harmonizing and awakening the Bindu Chakra. It explores the qualities and transformative potentials associated with this energy center and serves as a means for individuals to access and embody higher levels of consciousness.</p>
<p>By working with the Bindu Chakra, practitioners in Tantrism seek to cultivate spiritual insight, expanded awareness, and a direct connection with the divine. It serves as a focal point for the integration of spiritual energies and the realization of one's true nature.</p>
<p><b><u>बैन्दवचक्रस्य त्रिरूपत्वम् (Baindavachakrasya Trirupatvam)</b></u> in Tantrism refers to the triune nature or threefold aspect of the Bindu Chakra. The Bindu Chakra, also known as the Ajna Chakra or the Third Eye, is an important energy center associated with higher consciousness and spiritual insight.</p>

<p>By contemplating and realizing these five states of being, the practitioner gains a deeper understanding of the multidimensional nature of existence and consciousness. It allows for the expansion of awareness, the recognition of the divine presence in all states, and the realization of the ultimate reality beyond duality. This practice facilitates spiritual growth, self-realization, and the embodiment of the divine in the tantric tradition.</p>

<p><b><u>गुरुमुखाच्छास्त्रमधिगन्तव्यम् (Gurumukhācchāstramadhigantavyam)</b></u> is a phrase in Sanskrit that can be translated as "Scriptures should be learned from the Guru's mouth" or "The teachings of the scriptures should be obtained from the Guru."</p>
<p>In the context of Tantra, this phrase emphasizes the importance of receiving spiritual knowledge and guidance directly from a qualified Guru or spiritual teacher. It highlights the significance of the living transmission of wisdom and the oral tradition in understanding and practicing Tantric teachings.</p>
<p>According to Tantric tradition, the Guru is considered a source of wisdom, guidance, and initiation into the esoteric practices of Tantra. The Guru is seen as a spiritual preceptor who possesses the knowledge, experience, and realization of the tantric path. They serve as a bridge between the aspirant and the divine, guiding the student on their spiritual journey and imparting teachings that are not easily accessible through books or intellectual study alone.</p>
<p>By emphasizing the importance of learning from the Guru's mouth, the phrase emphasizes the need for direct personal instruction, transmission, and clarification from an authentic Guru. It implies that the true essence of the scriptures, their hidden meanings, and practical application can only be truly understood and realized through direct contact with a qualified Guru who has mastered the teachings and embodies their essence.</p>
<p>This principle underscores the importance of establishing a close relationship with a Guru, who can provide guidance, answer questions, correct misconceptions, and help the student navigate the complexities and subtleties of the tantric path. It stresses the significance of the Guru-disciple relationship in Tantric practice, where the transmission of knowledge occurs not only through intellectual study but also through direct experiential transmission, initiation, and personal guidance.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while the guidance of a Guru is valuable, the seeker should exercise discernment and choose a Guru who is authentic, knowledgeable, and aligned with their spiritual aspirations. The Guru-disciple relationship should be based on mutual trust, respect, and a genuine commitment to the spiritual path.</p>
<p><b><u>बलिनिवेदनम् (Balinivedanam)</b></u> in Tantrism refers to the ritualistic offering of sacrifices or oblations to the deities. It is a practice where material offerings, such as food, flowers, incense, and other objects, are consecrated and offered to the divine as a symbolic act of surrender, devotion, and gratitude.</p>
<p>The process of Balinivedanam typically involves the following steps:</p>
<p><b>1. Preparation of Offerings:</b> The practitioner gathers the necessary materials and substances for the offerings. These may include fruits, grains, sweets, flowers, incense, lamps, and sacred water. The offerings are carefully selected and prepared with purity and devotion.</p>
<p><b>2. Invocation:</b> The practitioner invokes the presence of the deity or deities to whom the offerings will be made. This is done through the recitation of specific mantras, prayers, and invocations that establish a connection with the divine and invite their presence.</p>
<p><b>3. Consecration:</b> The offerings are consecrated and sanctified through the recitation of mantras, visualization, and the infusion of divine energies. This process charges the offerings with spiritual potency and transforms them into sacred substances worthy of being presented to the deity.</p>
<p><b>4. Offering:</b> The practitioner presents the consecrated offerings to the deity. This can be done by placing them on an altar, in front of an idol or image, or at a sacred space designated for the ritual. The offerings may be arranged in a specific manner or according to the prescribed rituals of the tradition.</p>
<p><b>5. Prayer and Surrender:</b> While making the offering, the practitioner expresses devotion, surrender, and gratitude to the deity. Prayers, mantras, and invocations are recited to seek blessings, guidance, and the fulfillment of specific desires or intentions.</p>
<p><b>6. Sharing of Prasada:</b> After the offering is made, the blessed substances or prasada are distributed among the participants or devotees present during the ritual. Prasada is considered to carry the divine blessings and is consumed or treasured as a sacred gift from the deity.</p>
<p>Balinivedanam is a ritualistic practice that allows the practitioner to express their devotion, surrender, and gratitude to the divine. It is a means of establishing a personal connection and relationship with the deity, seeking their blessings, and cultivating a sense of unity and oneness with the divine presence. The offerings made during Balinivedanam symbolize the offering of one's worldly possessions, ego, and attachments to the divine, recognizing that everything ultimately belongs to the divine and is offered in service and devotion.</p>
<p><b><u>शास्त्रस्य गोपनीयताविधिः (Shastrasya Gopanīyatāvidhih)</b></u> in Tantrism refers to the protocols and guidelines regarding the secrecy and confidentiality of tantric scriptures and teachings. Tantric texts and teachings are considered sacred and esoteric, containing profound spiritual knowledge and practices that are meant to be guarded and transmitted with discretion.</p>
<p>The principles of Shastrasya Gopanīyatāvidhih can include the following:</p>
<p><b>1. Initiatory Transmission:</b> Tantric teachings are often transmitted through an initiatory process, where the Guru imparts knowledge and practices to a chosen disciple. This transmission is considered sacred and is meant to be kept confidential, shared only with those who have undergone the necessary preparations and commitments.</p>
<p><b>2. Secrecy of Texts:</b> Many tantric texts are written in coded language, using symbolism and metaphorical expressions. This is done to protect the deeper meaning of the teachings and ensure that they are accessible only to those who have received proper initiation and guidance. The texts may be kept hidden or restricted from public access to maintain their sanctity.</p>
<p><b>3. Guru-Disciple Relationship:</b> The teachings of Tantra are often passed down within the Guru-disciple relationship. The Guru serves as the custodian of the teachings and guides the disciple in their understanding and practice. The relationship is built on trust, respect, and a commitment to maintaining the confidentiality of the teachings.</p>
<p><b>4. Vows of Secrecy:</b> Initiates of Tantra may take vows of secrecy or oaths to safeguard the teachings. These vows bind the practitioner to maintain confidentiality, refrain from disclosing the teachings to unauthorized individuals, and uphold the sacredness of the tradition.</p>
<p><b>5. Oral Transmission:</b> Tantric teachings are often transmitted orally from the Guru to the disciple. This ensures the direct and personal transmission of knowledge, allowing for nuanced understanding, clarification of doubts, and the preservation of the intended meaning and context.</p>
<p>The protocols of Shastrasya Gopanīyatāvidhih are intended to preserve the purity, authenticity, and integrity of tantric teachings. They emphasize the need for respect, discretion, and the responsible handling of esoteric knowledge. The secrecy and confidentiality associated with tantric scriptures and teachings aim to protect the depth and potency of the practices, ensuring that they are passed down in an appropriate manner and received by sincere and dedicated practitioners who are ready to undertake the tantric path.</p>

The operation of the Guna which produce these types affect, on the gross material plane, the animal tendencies; manifesting in the three chief physical functions: eating and drinking, whereby the Annamayakosha is maintained; and sexual intercourse, by which it is reproduced. These functions are the subject of the Panchatattva or Panchamakara ("five Ms"), as they are vulgarly called--viz.: Madya (wine), Mamsa (meat), Matsya (fish), Mudra (parched grain), and Maithuna. In ordinary parlance, Mudra means ritual gestures or positions of the body in worship and Hatha Yoga but as one of the five elements it is parched cereal and is defined as 'Bhrishta-danya dikang yadyad chavya-niyam prachaks-hate, sa mudra kathita devi sarvves-hang naganam-dini'. The Tantras speak of the five elements as Panchatattva, Kuladravya, Kulatattva and certain of the elements have esoteric names, such as Karanavari or Tirtha-vari, for wine, the fifth element being usually called Lata-sadhana (Sadhana with woman or Shakti). The five elements, moreover have various meanings, according as they form part of the Tamasika (Pashvachara), Rajasika (Virachara) or Divya or Sattvika sadhanas respectively. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchamakara"

This pati differ from ordinary cowherd as he doesn't obtain any advantages either by growing or shepherding cattle, and pashus cannot realize anything with their limited movement caused by pasha.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%C5%9Ba"

This represents a sense of individuality and a separation from a general existence of any "divine plan". In Shaivism, anava is the cause of the individual soul's mistaken sense of separate identity from Universal God Shiva, and the last bond broken before union (yoga) or self-realization (moksha).<a href=""

                                          The Tantraloka is a major treatise on the philosophy and practice of Tantra, written by the Indian philosopher and mystic Abhinavagupta. Abhinavagupta was a prolific writer and commentator on Tantra and Kashmir Shaivism, a tradition of Hindu philosophy that emphasizes the direct experience of the divine.<br>
                                             Abhinavagupta lived in Kashmir, India, during the 10th and 11th centuries CE. He was born into a family of scholars and received a rigorous education in the Vedic scriptures, the Puranas, and the Tantras. He also received training in the arts, including music, dance, and poetry, and became a master of the Kashmiri language.<br>
                                            Abhinavagupta's writings on Tantra and Kashmir Shaivism are considered to be some of the most profound and insightful in the history of Indian philosophy. His works emphasize the importance of direct experience and personal realization of the divine, rather than simply following external rituals and dogmas.<br>
                                             The Tantraloka is considered to be one of Abhinavagupta's most important works. It is a comprehensive treatise on the philosophy and practice of Tantra, divided into 37 chapters or "prakaranas". The text covers a wide range of topics, including the nature of ultimate reality, the role of the guru, the use of mantras and yantras in meditation, and the practice of kundalini yoga.<br>
                                             The Tantraloka is renowned for its philosophical depth and spiritual insight, and is considered to be a masterpiece of Indian philosophy. It has had a profound influence on the development of Tantra and Kashmir Shaivism, and continues to be studied and revered by scholars and practitioners of these traditions to this day. <a href=""

                                                           The first chapter or "prakarana" of Tantraloka is called "Sambandha", which means "relationship". This chapter establishes the fundamental principles of Kashmir Shaivism, including the concept of "Shiva" as the ultimate reality or consciousness, and "Shakti" as the creative energy or power that emanates from Shiva.<br>
                                                            Abhinavagupta explains that the individual self or "jiva" is a reflection or "pratibimba" of the ultimate reality. He emphasizes that the individual self is not separate from the ultimate reality, but rather is an expression of it.</br>
                                                            The chapter also discusses the various states of consciousness that the individual self can experience, including waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. Abhinavagupta introduces the concept of "tattvas", which are the fundamental principles or categories of existence.<br>
                                                            Throughout this chapter, Abhinavagupta emphasizes the importance of direct experience and self-realization as the means for understanding the nature of the relationship between the individual self and the ultimate reality. He stresses that this understanding cannot be achieved through intellectual analysis or external practices alone, but must be realized through direct experience of the innermost nature of the self.<br>
                                                            Overall, the first prakarana of Tantraloka lays the groundwork for the entire text, establishing the basic principles and framework for understanding the philosophy and practice of Kashmir Shaivism and Tantra. It emphasizes the importance of direct experience and self-realization as the means for understanding the ultimate reality and one's relationship to it. <a href=""
